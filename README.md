# Project Name: Can of Books - Backend

**Author**: Katrina Hill
**Version**: 2.0.0

## Overview
This application will allow a user to track what books have impacted them and will recommend the next book the user should read.

## Getting Started
To get started using this app, a user must first create the following files: server. js, sample.env, and .env. In the server.js file, write the requirements for the server, bring in Mongoose and the schema called Book.js. The user will also need to connect Mongoose with MongoDB, add a validation to confirm Mongoose is connected to MongoDB. In addition, the user will need to define the PORT to validate the .env file is working, add a test message as a response, as well as async the getBooks function to identify what needs to be done when the email is returned from the query. 

The user will also need to create a Book.js schema to define how the schema will be structured as well as to be brought into server.js.

The books.js file needs to be created to 'seed' the database wtih books.

## Architecture
This application uses React on the front-end and Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose on the back-end. A npm was installed to deploy the front-end as well as to get the dependencies for express, cors, and dotenv. Nodemon was also installed deploy the development server.

## Change Log
3/28/2022 2:30pm - Application was started by installing npm and Mongoose. Installed npm dependencies and Mongoose. Pushed to GitHub and merged to main. Deployed to MongoDB.

## Estimates

# Start your own "Can of Books" App
This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Use this template

Clone this repo to your own account with the green "Use this template" button. Then, add any collaborators. Now you are ready to start adding features! Deploy your site to let the world know which books have had the greatest impact on you, and what's recommended. Enjoy!

## Contractural agreement

## Logistical

What hours will you be available to communicate? Katrina and Roger: available 1-6pm (lab hours)
What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? Slack works for both of us.
How often will you take breaks? Every 45-50 minutes, take a break.
What is your plan if you start to fall behind? Check in with other and ask for TA help.

## Cooperative

Make a list of each parson’s strengths. Katrina: good at Google and back-end. Roger: good with front-end.
How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application? Lean on each other to complete the project.

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength? Roger: problem-solving, getting stuck and not understanding error. The error codes are general and not specific. Debugging. Katrina: get better at the back-end and connecting it to the front-end.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development? Checking in with each other in the morning and afternoon before the end of lab to see what the status is of the project. Time box earlier than the close of lab to review and go over anything we didn’t understand.

## Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing? Communicate. Talk to each other about anything we don’t understand and need help with.

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute? Take time out and express our feelings about not being able to contribute property.

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? Communication and letting each other know that we don’t understand the material and need help.
