# Project Name: Can of Books - Backend

**Author**: Katrina Hill
**Version**: 2.0.0

## Overview
This application will allow a user to track what books have impacted them and will recommend the next book the user should read.

## Getting Started
To get started using this app, a user must first create the following files: server. js, sample.env, and .env. In the server.js file, write the requirements for the server, bring in Mongoose and the schema called Book.js. The user will also need to connect Mongoose with MongoDB, add a validation to confirm Mongoose is connected to MongoDB. In addition, the user will need to define the PORT to validate the .env file is working, add a test message as a response, as well as async the getBooks function to identify what needs to be done when the email is returned from the query. 

The user will also need to create a Book.js schema to define how the schema will be structured as well as to be brought into server.js.

The books.js file needs to be created to 'seed' the database wtih books.

## Architecture
This application uses React on the front-end and Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose on the back-end. A npm was installed to deploy the front-end as well as to get the dependencies for express, cors, and dotenv. Nodemon was also installed deploy the development server.

## Change Log
